# web-a-go-go
This is a Spring Boot web application exercise. And it's a game of Go :) 

This is also the first time I create a project on GitHub, so: Hello World!

# What you'll need
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/)
* [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or later
* [Maven 3.0+](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* [Redis](http://redis.io/download) (For Windows, see [here](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releases). You may need to change the user running the Redis service during installation process, and start the service again to successfully install Redis for Windows)
* [Spring Tool Suite](https://spring.io/tools/sts/all) or other capable IDE or your choice (optional). Pick the right version (64bit etc) or the STS will fail with a bit confusing error message

# Building and running
* Check out the source code by typing `git clone https://github.com/anttikarhu/web-a-go-go.git web-a-go-go`
* Go to the folder `cd web-a-go-go`
* Type `mvn spring-boot:run`
* Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your web browser
